# Simple Daily Calender and Planner
# Introduction
The Simple Planner is a basic web-based application that allows users to organize their daily tasks and plans. It provides an interactive timetable where users can add tasks and view their plans for the day.

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript concepts like:

DOM manipulation.
Functions and nested functions(function in other functions).
Conditional statements (if).
Basic loops(for).
Itâ€™s a great starting point for beginners looking to practice JavaScript and HTML and even CSS.

# Features
Displays the current date based on the user's local region using Date().
Allows users to add plans or tasks by clicking on the timetable.
Prompts the user for the task name and its intended time.
Handles syntax errors to ensure a smooth user experience.
(If you find any bugs, feel free to report them!)
# Installation
Download the provided RAR file.
Extract the Simple Planner folder from the archive.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Note:
Since the project doesn't use frameworks like React.js or JSON, the layout may not perform equally well on mobile devices compared to desktops.

# Usage
Open the planner in your browser.
Click on the timetable to add a new task.
A prompt will appear:
Enter the task name.
Specify the intended time for the task.
Your task will then appear in the timetable.
